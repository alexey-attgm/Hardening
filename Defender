Windows Server and passive mode
On Windows Server 2019, Windows Server, version 1803 or newer, Windows Server 2016, or Windows Server 2012 R2, Microsoft Defender Antivirus doesn't enter passive mode automatically when you install a non-Microsoft antivirus product. In those cases, set Microsoft Defender Antivirus to passive mode to prevent problems caused by having multiple antivirus products installed on a server. You can set Microsoft Defender Antivirus to passive mode using a registry key as follows:

Path: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection
Name: ForceDefenderPassiveMode
Type: REG_DWORD
Value: 1
